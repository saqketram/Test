# Simple Calculator App

This is a simple command-line calculator application written in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

## Features

- **Addition** (`+`)
- **Subtraction** (`-`)
- **Multiplication** (`*`)
- **Division** (`/`)
- **Modulo** (`%`)
- Handles **invalid inputs** (non-numeric values, unsupported operators)
- **Prevents division by zero** with appropriate error messages
- **User-friendly error messages** for easier understanding

## Requirements

This app requires Python to run. The app has been tested with Python 3.x, and it should work on any platform that supports Python.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd calculator-app
    ```

3. Run the app using Python:

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

4. You will be prompted to input:
    - The **first number**
    - The **operation** you want to perform (choose from `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
    - The **second number**

5. After entering the inputs, the program will perform the operation and display the result. In case of invalid inputs (non-numeric values or unsupported operators), the program will show clear error messages.

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter first number: 10
Enter any one operation (+, -, *, /, %): +
Enter second number: 5
The sum of the two numbers is: 15
```

In case of an invalid operator:

```bash
Enter first number: 10
Enter any one operation (+, -, *, /, %): 5
Error: Invalid operator. Please enter one of (+, -, *, /, %).
```

In case of an invalid number:

```bash
Enter first number: abc
Error: Please enter a valid number. Only numeric values are allowed.
```

In case of division by zero:

```bash
Enter first number: 10
Enter any one operation (+, -, *, /, %): /
Enter second number: 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
```

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Operator**: The program checks if the entered operator is one of the valid operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`). If not, an error message is shown.
- **Non-numeric Inputs**: If the user enters anything that is not a number, the program will notify the user with a clear error message.
- **Division by Zero**: If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will provide an error message and prevent the operation.
